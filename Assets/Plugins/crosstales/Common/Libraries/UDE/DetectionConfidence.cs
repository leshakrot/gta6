   ///  SureAnswer: the detector is 100% sure about the  answer.

   ///  Example 1: the Shift_JIS/ISO-2022-JP/EUC-JP detector return
   ///    this w/ ISO-2022-JP when it hit one of the following ESC seq
   ///     ESC ( J
   ///     ESC $ @
   ///     ESC $ B

   ///  Example 2: the detector which can detect UCS2 return w/ UCS2
   ///     when the first 2 byte are BOM mark.
   ///  Example 3: the Korean detector return ISO-2022-KR when it
   ///     hit ESC $ ) C
